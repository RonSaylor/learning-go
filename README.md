# Learning Go
Decided to learn Go for fun. I'll probably keep notes here as I work through tutorials and other exercises.

* 3/14/2024: Creted project and worked through Go tutorial: [Developing a RESTful API with Go and Gin](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin)
* 3/14/2024: Switched from in-memory db to mysql db  using Go Tutorial: [Accessing a relational database](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/database-access)
